Understand Reactjs step by step

## Create Project

If you've previously installed create-react-app globally via npm install -g create-react-app, we recommend you uninstall the package using npm uninstall -g create-react-app to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.

To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:

### npx
npx create-react-app my-app

### npm
npm init react-app my-app
